title: Simulating Lightning in the Atmosphere
summary: During my time as a graduate student, my EM professor who is something of an expert in lightning tasked me with studying Lightning Pulses in the atmosphere. This project takes you through what that project was like including the historical data that laid the foundation and the Finite Difference Time Domain method that was studied for the followup software that the professor would later achieve after the results of this research concluded.
