title: 3D Realtime Heat Conduction Simulation using the Finite Element Method in Unreal Engine
summary: During my recent employment as a Simulation and AI Systems Engineer, I was tasked with developing a hyper realistic and performant heat conduction system. The system would be utilized in a VR environment developed on and hosted by the Unreal Engine. It is a 3D realtime solution of the Fourier Heat Conduction system and acts as Phase I of a three phase plan I had developed for achieving an optimally realistic and performant Welding simulation system for my employer. This project provides images, videos, and other shareable information, project files, and code. It is provided for demonstration.
