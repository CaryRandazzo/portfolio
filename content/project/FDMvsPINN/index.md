title: FDM vs PINN
summary: During the course of my simulation work, I had encountered both Finite Differencing Method(FDM) and their how accurate they tend to be and newer AI based methods particularly so-called Physics Informed Neural Networks(PINNs). I had reviewed research on PINNs briefly and had believed them to be inferior to mesh based methods, however I did not want to discount there potential usefullness. In this project, I tasked myself with determining the limitations of PINNs as as simulation method when compared to the FDM in the context of a relatively well known heat conduction system where the ground truth information for the comparison were the time of execution and the precise analytic solution of the system under specific conditions. The results turned out to be enlightning and gratifying and I intend to explore more complex tests in the future.
