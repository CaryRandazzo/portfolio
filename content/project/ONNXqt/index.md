title: ONNX based ML Integration System for CERN's ATLAS Experiment
summary: In CERN's ATLAS Experiment, the Data Quality group has scientists working to constantly improve data quality recently using a host of Machine Learning techniques. This project, as part of my official qualification for authorship on ATLAS, tasks me with making a straightforward system to integrate new machine learning algorithms into the main framework ATLAS uses called ATHENA. It has been decided that the software which will facilitate this integration will be the ONNX framework. This project is showcased here.
