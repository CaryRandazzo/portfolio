title: Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Mesh Based Methods
summary: There are many simulation algorithms that utilize mesh systems, this project focuses on a heavily researched technique that greatly improves both accuracy in refined regions and performance of mesh dependent calculations everywhere in the simulation. This project utilized the C programming language and could be adapted to various dimensions and objectives for simulation - it functions here as a demonstration.
